Beancount's journal format is similar to hledger's,
but different enough that neither can read the other's files.

## hledger to Beancount

Use hledger's [print](hledger.md#print) command, which supports [Beancount output](hledger.md#beancount-output).

This can be useful for viewing hledger data in [Fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/), egË˜. In simple cases it can be:
```
$ hledger print -o tmp.beancount
$ fava tmp.beancount
```

## Beancount to hledger

Use Beancount 2's [bean-report](https://beancount.github.io/docs/running_beancount_and_generating_reports.html#bean-report) tool.
(It's not available with Beancount 3):
```
$ bean-report foo.beancount hledger > foo.hledger
```

This will convert `@@` total costs to `@` unit costs, which tends to create precision problems,
causing hledger to complain that transactions are unbalanced.
To fix it, declare a sensible display/balancing precision for each commodity, like this,
using two decimal places or however many is appropriate:
```journal
commodity 1.00 USD
commodity 1.00 EUR
...
```
Here's the doc for [commodity directive](https://hledger.org/dev/hledger.html#commodity-directive).
