# hledger by example

A growing "book" introducing hledger one step at a time.

Examples assume the latest hledger version; and on Windows, a powershell window, not CMD.

For now, enable the site sidebar to see the book's table of contents.
<!-- For now, see the outline at [Docs: hledger by example](doc.md#hledger-by-example). -->

You can use the left and right arrow buttons on this page,
or press the left and right arrow keys, to step through the pages.
Eg press the right arrow key now to step to the next page.
