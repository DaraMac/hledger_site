# hledger by example

A growing "book" introducing hledger one step at a time.

For now, enable the site's sidebar to see the book's outline.
<!-- For now, see the outline at [Docs: hledger by example](doc.md#hledger-by-example). -->

You could use the left and right arrow keys to step through the pages.
(Press right arrow now to step to the next page.)

Examples assume the latest hledger version; and on Windows, a powershell window, not CMD.
