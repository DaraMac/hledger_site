# hledger by example

The beginnings of a "hledger by example" book.

<!-- For now, see the outline at [Docs: hledger by example](doc.md#hledger-by-example). -->

Some notes about these examples:

- For now, enable the site's sidebar to see the book's outline.
- You can use the left and right arrow keys to step through the pages.
  Eg press right arrow now to step to the next page.
- Examples assume the latest hledger version.
- On Windows, examples assume a powershell window (not a CMD window).

Show don't tell. Keep prose brief.
