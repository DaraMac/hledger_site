# Tips for learning hledger

## Pace yourself

Starting out with plain text accounting and hledger,
learning enough double entry bookkeeping,
setting up a new accounting system, 
and bringing order to your financial life, can be a lot.

Remember these are valuable skills, which take time to master.

## Support

Your fellow users can provide [Support](support.md). The chats are great for that.
(Especially matrix chat, which supports persistent history, long messages, code blocks, reactions, voice/video calls, etc.)

## Look ahead

If you're starting out with PTA, here's what's probably ahead.
Note each of these can start out super simple and be refined over time,
and old entries can always be improved retroactively.

- Check your hledger setup, and start a journal file.
- Build up a set of account names/categories best suited to your situation.
- Learn suitable journal entries for your typical transactions.
- Learn how to catch and fix errors easily.
- Learn how to produce reports useful for you.
- Find convenient and efficient workflows for data entry, reconciling, reporting, backups, etc.

## Motivation

Find things that get you in the mood and energised. 
<!-- - Maybe a pile of bills ? -->
- Maybe doing accounts for a friend or family member ?
- Maybe a [video or talk](videos.md) ?
- Maybe a book ?

## Little and often

Accounting is an ongoing activity, best done in regular small doses.
The more often you do it, the easier it is, because less has happened and you can remember it.
Ten minutes daily can achieve a lot. (Or less, once you get a routine going.)

## Imperfection

Your bookkeeping does not have to be perfect or even completely accurate
(though, you may find accurate bookkeeping satisfying and confidence-building!)

As you practice, you will naturally learn more about the tools and
about double-entry accounting,
such as how to organise your account categories,
and how to write effective journal entries for various real-world events (transactions).

Later you can come back and improve your old journal entries if you wish.
You can decide what level of accuracy you need.

## Small steps

<!-- just keep taking small steps - pretty soon you'll be much further along. -->

You can start using hledger in very simple ways, and get immediate benefit.
Prioritise your work: a good way is to think about your most pressing needs and what kind of report would help.
For example,

- Take inventory of your debts, loans and assets; write down the names and numbers.
- Record these as "opening balances" transactions (as in the quick start docs).
- Make corrections until hledger shows your balances accurately.

Or:

- Start recording changes to the cash in your wallet, starting with today's balance.
- Then start reconciling daily (comparing the reported and actual balance, and troubleshooting any disagreements).
- Then start tracking the balance in your checking account.
- Then start tracking your other bank accounts.
- Then start categorising your incomes and expenses.
- Then find your bank transaction history and manually enter the transactions from the previous week.
- Then manually download your bank transactions as CSV and develop CSV rules so that you can print the CSV as journal entries.
- Then try downloading and importing this CSV into your journal daily for a while.
  (Only if you wish. Many people stick to manual data entry for the increased awareness it brings.)

If the task feels unclear or overwhelming, I recommend this small steps, verifiable reports approach.

If not, of course feel free to blaze away and do it all on day one.
But I would still recommend establishing a frequent reconciling routine.
It is *surprising* how quickly small events can slip through the cracks and create chaos,
and it takes a little time to develop the troubleshooting skills.
Reconciling often will save you time.

Notes

I'll throw out the obvious: read the docs at hledger.org. Particularly the reference manuals for hledger and hledger-web - these are also available as local man pages and info manuals - but hledger.org has them with useful hyperlinks, and has additional docs such as FAQ, Cookbook and Developer docs. Clearly you shouldn't have to read this.. library.. up front, but at least survey everything, including the tables of contents, to get a sense of where things are.
There's also a Videos page; and at https://plaintextaccounting.org/#articles-blog-posts , many bite-sized blog posts. These can be a nice alternative when reading docs gets boring.
There's a lot of rabbit holes you can go down when learning PTA, so setting some goals and managing your focus is helpful. Lisp, Haskell and Emacs are also big topics and definitely not needed for hledger use, though very fun and worthwhile in themselves.
You can always browse the mail list archives for past discussions that look interesting. And I will always recommend joining the hledger chat - a little bit of a hoop but not much. Checking the discussion there once in a while, or asking when you get stuck, can save a lot of time.
(answer to:
 B: I am not a coder/programmer/software professional—just a numbers-inclined user who is old enough to remember pre-GUI computing, appreciates the philosophy of plain text accounting, and had dabbled with code (Processing, Arduino, and HTML/CSS once upon a time).
 ...
 Now, I’m wondering if anyone here could offer some guidance towards a strategic course of study that would help me get the most out of hledger? Should I learn Lisp? Haskell? Maybe focus on understanding how to use Emacs?
 I do believe that continued use of hledger will drive more learning (It already has!) but I can’t help but think that troubleshooting as questions and issues arise isn’t the only (or most effective) way. There’s a lot of lingo, terms—a whole universe truly—that is new to me and I’m curious now that I have arrived where others might recommend I start to get a better sense of the lay of the land so to speak.

## Fun

Find ways to make it fun. Connecting with the PTA community online can be one way. And take breaks.
